          <span>Information Request Guidelines</span>
          <br />
          <p>Updated: August 8th, 2022</p>
        </ConverTitle>
        <span>1. WHEN WILL THESE GUIDELINES APPLY?</span>
        <br />
        The Guidelines apply to requests for information about user(s) by a law
        enforcement authority only. These Guidelines do not apply to requests
        from other third parties for information about user(s). The Guidelines
        are not intended to set out the process for responding to an
        individual’s request for access to his or her own personal information
        in the custody or control of GHOST. <a>The Privacy Policy</a> should be
        consulted when dealing with an individual’s request for personal
        information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          2. WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ITS USERS DOES GHOST HAVE ACCESS TO?
        </span>
        <br />
        Our applications are built with security and privacy in mind, retaining
        the least amount of data possible. As such, our Services only retain
        data to the extent required to provide users with access, and ensure
        reliability of access, to the Services. This information may include
        information about the device(s) of the user(s), but does not include
        personal information such as the user’s email address, name or phone
        number. Please refer to our <a>Privacy Policy</a> for additional
        details.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>3. DOES GHOST HAVE ACCESS TO THE CONTENT OF ITS USERS?</span>
        <br />
        No. GHOST does not have access to read or review the encrypted ephemeral
        files or information sent and received by its users using the Services.
        Where the information sought in connection with a valid law enforcement
        request relates to the content of any of its users, GHOST’s response to
        this request will reflect the fact that GHOST does not have access to
        the content of its users, that such content, in any case, is end-to-end
        encrypted with private keys generated and held by users and
        indecipherable.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>4. WHAT IS GHOST’S APPROACH TO LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS?</span>
        <br />
        GHOST will typically only release information about its users to a law
        enforcement authority when compelled to do so by court order, warrant,
        subpoena or other legal authority having jurisdiction to compel GHOST to
        disclose the information. All requests must be made in writing and
        submitted to GHOST, by mail, fax or email, as follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>GHOST AGENCY LIMITED</p>
        <p>Attention: Legal Process</p>
        <br />
        <p>Unit 2A, 17/F, Glenealy Tower, No.1 Glenealy</p>
        <p>Central, Hong Kong S.A.R</p>
        <p>E-mail: legal@GoGhost.org</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          5. HOW DOES GHOST ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS ARE LEGITIMATE?
        </span>
        <br />
        GHOST will confirm the identity of the requestor. To that end, GHOST
        will review the information provided, including:
        <br />
        Privacy policies of third-party partners: We also engage with certain
        third-party partners, who share our profound dedication to the
        protection of privacy, to help us improve our Services. We use an email
        marketing platform on the Website to create and manage mailing lists,
        newsletters and automated marketing campaigns. We also use an open
        source, self-hosted web analytics application that tracks online visits
        to websites and displays reports.
        <br />
        the name of the law enforcement authority;
        <br />
        the requesting agent’s name or badge ID;
        <br />
        a valid official law enforcement email address;
        <br />
        the requesting agent’s phone number (with extension if applicable); and
        <br />
        a verifiable physical mailing address (a P.O. Box will not be accepted).
        <br />
        Upon receipt of a formal written request, GHOST will ensure that the
        request includes the following details:
        <br />
        the information sought. This description should be as specific as
        possible. GHOST will construe the requests narrowly to ensure that the
        information disclosed does not exceed the scope of the request and is
        limited to the information required by law;
        <br />
        the purpose for which the law enforcement authority is seeking the
        information (including its intended use and disclosure of the
        information);
        <br />
        GHOST may exceptionally disclose relevant information about user(s)
        without first receiving and confirming proof of legal authority where it
        is evident that the information is being requested as part of a criminal
        investigation and there is some urgency in obtaining the information;
        e.g., where a law enforcement authority requests information about a
        device which has been used to access child pornography, or where the
        information reveals an imminent threat of harm to persons or property.
        Further, in response to a valid emergency disclosure request, GHOST may
        provide information to a law enforcement authority. Such disclosure
        requests will be reviewed and evaluated on an individual basis,
        considering applicable law. If information received demonstrates that an
        exigent emergency exists involving a risk of death or serious physical
        injury to a person, or an imminent threat to GHOST or the Services it
        offers, information may be provided to law enforcement to prevent such
        harm, if necessary. Such an emergency disclosure request should be sent
        in the same manner as outlined above in Section 4 of these Guidelines.
        <br />
        the requested response date.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>6. WHAT ABOUT AN EMERGENCY REQUEST?</span>
        <br />
        GHOST may exceptionally disclose relevant information about user(s)
        without first receiving and confirming proof of legal authority where it
        is evident that the information is being requested as part of a criminal
        investigation and there is some urgency in obtaining the information;
        e.g., where a law enforcement authority requests information about a
        device which has been used to access child pornography, or where the
        information reveals an imminent threat of harm to persons or property.
        Further, in response to a valid emergency disclosure request, GHOST may
        provide information to a law enforcement authority. Such disclosure
        requests will be reviewed and evaluated on an individual basis,
        considering applicable law. If information received demonstrates that an
        exigent emergency exists involving a risk of death or serious physical
        injury to a person, or an imminent threat to GHOST or the Services it
        offers, information may be provided to law enforcement to prevent such
        harm, if necessary. Such an emergency disclosure request should be sent
        in the same manner as outlined above in Section 4 of these Guidelines.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>7. WILL USERS BE NOTIFIED OF REQUESTS?</span>
        <br />
        Except where required by law to keep the existence of a request
        confidential or where GHOST considers, in its sole discretion, that
        providing notice could create an imminent threat of harm to persons or
        property, GHOST may notify the user(s) of any requests made.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>8. PRESERVATION REQUESTS</span>
        <br />
        Upon receipt of a valid preservation request, GHOST will preserve the
        information about the user(s) for the period indicated in the
        preservation request (the Preservation Period), pending the receipt of a
        valid law enforcement request. GHOST will only disclose information
        which has been preserved upon receipt of a court order, warrant,
        subpoena or other legal authority having jurisdiction to compel GHOST to
        disclose the information, in accordance with these Guidelines. If GHOST
        does not receive a valid law enforcement request for the preserved
        information before the end of the Preservation Period, GHOST may delete
        the preserved information when the Preservation Period expires.
        Preservation requests may be submitted in writing to GHOST to the
        contact information provided in <a>Section 4</a> of these Guidelines.
        Preservation requests must:
        <br />
        be sent on official law enforcement letterhead;
        <br />
        be signed by a law enforcement official;
        <br />
        provide a valid official law enforcement email address;
        <br />
        provide the legal basis for the request and the authority of the
        request; and
        <br />
        include a statement outlining the specific steps being taken to obtain a
        court order, warrant, subpoena or other legal authority for the
        information sought to be preserved and the expected timeline.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>9. DOES GHOST RESPOND TO MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES?</span>
        <br />
        GHOST will promptly respond to requests issued by a Hong Kong court upon
        proper service of process either by way of mutual legal assistance
        treaty or letter rogatory. Similarly, as a courtesy to international law
        enforcement agencies, GHOST will review and respond to properly
        submitted preservation requests while the mutual legal assistance treaty
        or letters rogatory process is on-going. All such requests will be
        evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with both these
        Guidelines and applicable laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>10. CHANGES TO THE GUIDELINES</span>
        <br />
        GHOST reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, replace or
        otherwise update these Guidelines from time to time. Thereafter, the
        Guidelines as updated will be made available and easily accessible on
        our website located at <a>https://GoGhost.org/</a>. Anyone may determine
        whether these Guidelines have changed by looking at the effective date
        appearing at the top of said Guidelines.
        <br />
        <br />
