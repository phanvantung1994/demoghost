        <span>1. SECURITY FOR COMMUNICATION DATA</span>
        <br />
        GHOST takes its commitment to protect the security and privacy of your
        personal information seriously. Our security measures aim to maintain
        data accuracy and to protect your personal information from losses,
        theft or unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, misuse or
        modification.
        <br /> Keeping your information safe: We care about the security of your
        information and employ safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and
        security of all information transmitted through our Services. Our
        algorithmic process ensures that all communication data sent through our
        Services is end-to-end encrypted to ensure that your encoded
        communication is delivered to the recipient securely. Only the recipient
        has access to a unique decryption key to transform the coded information
        into a readable text.
        <br />
        The integrity of your communication is assured during its transit
        because GHOST uses:
        <br />
        end-to-end encryption protocols that verify integrity, i.e. protect
        against modification by an attacker.
        <br />
        transport layer security with pinned certificates, such that it would be
        very challenging for a man-in-the-middle to inject malicious
        certificates into the device’s trust store and/or decrypt traffic or
        modify any data in transit.
        <br />
        GHOST’s security measures also include:
        <br />
        ensuring server authentication and data encryption using Secure Sockets
        Layer technology (SSL) when Services are accessed via the Internet;
        <br />
        maintaining a strict control of the residual data retained on GHOST’s
        servers;
        <br />
        limiting access to the actual data transmitted to only you and its
        intended recipient; and
        <br />
        locating GHOST’s platform and servers in various data centers and
        deploying them at random. GHOST may use, among other things, content
        delivery networks and proxies to mitigate threats.
        <br />
        To increase the privacy of your data, please keep in mind that:
        <br />
        the information (including documents and attachments) you send to your
        contacts may remain on their device(s) even after you deleted it from
        your own device(s), depending on the parameters selected for such
        transmission or whether, for example, the recipient(s) took a photo or
        otherwise recorded it;
        <br />
        when sending or receiving any information, you should validate the
        identity and trustworthiness of the recipients; and
        <br />
        you should take security measures to ensure that the confidentiality of
        the information you send or receive is preserved after the transmission.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>2. PAYLOAD SECURITY</span>
        <br />
        Our Services retain as little data as possible for as little time as
        possible. The communication data transmitted on the servers (Payload)
        using our Services is end-to-end encrypted before its transmission to
        GHOST servers and relayed to the recipient’s device, such that GHOST
        cannot have access to your conversations through our communication
        services. The Payload is automatically deleted as soon as it is
        successfully delivered to the recipient. In the event the Payload cannot
        be immediately delivered, it is only temporarily stored on GHOST’s
        servers until the sooner of its successful delivery to the recipient or
        14 days, after which it is automatically purged.
        <br />
        Temporary payload storage and transfer: Your encrypted communication
        information may be stored temporarily in any country in which GHOST’s or
        its service providers’ servers are hosted, for the purposes of
        facilitating and securely completing your communication through the
        Services. Please note that we may transfer information to a country and
        jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
        jurisdiction, including any country in which GHOST or its affiliates or
        service providers maintain servers or facilities.
        <br />
        Security protocols: Your encrypted communications can only be decrypted
        with a private encryption key, which is only held by your intended
        recipient(s). In the unlikely event that personal information under our
        control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take
        reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate,
        notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and
        take other appropriate steps, in accordance with any applicable law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>3. AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</span>
        <br />
        Automatic collection of limited information is required to ensure the
        reliability of access to the Service. When you download, access, or use
        the Services, we may automatically collect the following information
        depending on your GHOST version:
        <br />
        GHOST Messenger (App Platforms)
        <br />
        Last login
        <br />
        Device model
        <br />
        App version
        <br />
        Operating system version
        <br />
        GHOST OS (Mobile Operating System)
        <br />
        Accessing GHOST through our mobile operating system (OS) deployment
        provides you with additional security measures such as a virtual private
        network (VPN) and strict information technology (IT) policies to
        increase data protection. This requires additional information to
        facilitate access to the Services:
        <br />
        Crash logs
        <br />
        Device model
        <br />
        Network state
        <br />
        SIM#, IMEI#, IMSI#
        <br />
        Mobile network information
        <br />
        GHOST’s applications leverage an on-premise crash reporting system in
        order to gather application performance and crash data, which does not
        contain any personal information. Additionally, GHOSTs applications
        allow you to trigger a reporting feature which contains application
        stack traces and information regarding events that occurred prior to and
        after a crash. Such a report also contains a plain text comments string
        allowing you to report comments related to the issue.
        <br />
        If any bug or error occurs, we may collect diagnostic information about
        your device. We use this additional information to enhance the security
        controls around the access to the Services and to resolve the bugs and
        errors that may exist. Diagnostic information includes:
        <br />
        Last login

        Device model
        <br />
        App version
        <br />
        Operating system version
        <br />
        Time zone
        <br />
        Language
        <br />
        Battery level
        <br />
        Free memory
        <br />
        Screen resolution
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>4. USER-PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR ACCESS TO SERVICES</span>
        <br />
        We do not associate personal information such as email address or phone
        number to GHOST accounts. No user information is required for account
        creation and Services access. Should we have access to any personal
        information about you from third-party sources, such as online
        application stores and platforms, we will not correlate such information
        with any account you create to use and access the Services.
        <br />
        GHOST account information: To provide you with access to the Service and
        to facilitate communication between GHOST contacts, GHOST stores your
        randomly generated GHOST Identification Number (GID), Alias information,
        and/or GHOST Mail email address. Since we do not collect personal
        information for account creation, GHOST Identification Number (GID),
        Alias information, and/or GHOST Mail email address is not associated
        with any personally identifiable information. GHOST will also request
        your password for entry to the application. We do not store passwords on
        our servers.
        <br />
        Payment information: Only if and when purchasing any fee-based feature
        of the Services, you may provide payment information to us or a
        third-party payment provider. We do not store your payment information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>5. USER-PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR COMMUNICATING WITH GHOST</span>
        <br />
        User-provided information for communication with GHOST: You may
        voluntarily provide GHOST with any suggestions, ideas, comments,
        questions or other feedback relating to your use of the Services,
        typically through our Website. We will handle the information received
        to (i) categorize the communication, (ii) respond to your feedback,
        (iii) send any information requested and/or (iv) ensure compliance with
        the <a>Terms of Use.</a>
        <br />
        Data storage and transfer: Any information which you submitted for the
        purposes of communicating with GHOST may be stored in any country in
        which GHOST’s or its service providers’ servers are hosted. Please note
        that we may transfer information to a country and jurisdiction that does
        not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, including
        any country in which GHOST or its affiliates or service providers
        maintain servers or facilities.
        <br />
        Retention of your information. We will only retain voluntarily submitted
        personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
        for which we received it, for the purposes of our legitimate business
        interests and for satisfying any legal requirement.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>6. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OUR GHOST RESELLER PARTNERS</span>
        <br />
        Our reseller partners (GHOST Reseller Partners) may share GHOST account
        details like GHOST ID (GID), GHOST Mail email address, or subscription
        details, with us so that we can deliver support services, update,
        upgrade or otherwise improve the Services, or to develop new services.
        GHOST Reseller Partners are not required to disclose personally
        identifiable information with us unless otherwise required by applicable
        law. Please note that our GHOST Reseller Partners are required to comply
        with applicable privacy and data collection laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>7. WEBSITE</span>
        <br />
        Process and security cookies: Our Website uses process cookies that
        allow it to work properly in keeping track of the sequence of orders or
        requests or when browsing from one page to the other, as well as
        security cookies that are used each time the Website is used for
        authentication, security, network management, and accessibility
        purposes. Through the use of cookies, GHOST may collect your browser
        information, Internet Protocol addresses, the interactions taking place
        with the Website and similar general information. While cookies cannot
        be blocked as they are essential for ensuring that the Website functions
        properly, they are of a temporary nature and will disappear when the
        browser software is closed, the device is turned off or restarted or if
        you manually delete them. Further, cookies are almost always assigned a
        validity period after which they are automatically purged from a
        browser’s local storage.
        <br />
        Privacy policies of third-party partners: We also engage with certain
        third-party partners, who share our profound dedication to the
        protection of privacy, to help us improve our Services. We use an email
        marketing platform on the Website to create and manage mailing lists,
        newsletters and automated marketing campaigns. We also use an open
        source, self-hosted web analytics application that tracks online visits
        to websites and displays reports.
        <br />
        Our Website may collect information only in connection with your
        browsing activity, as opposed to your use of our Services. We may
        collect for internal evaluation of the performance of our Services
        information about your device, browsing actions, and patterns such as:
        (i) usage details (including but not limited to traffic data, and the
        resources you access and use through our Website); and (ii) device
        information (including IP address, operating system and browser type).
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>8. LIMITING COLLECTION OF ALL USER DATA</span>
        <br />
        We have made it a priority to retain as little data as possible. The
        very limited information obtained about you, as detailed in this Privacy
        Policy, is always retained in a highly secure manner for the shortest
        possible period of time, only as long as it is necessary to provide you
        with the Services or to comply with applicable law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>9. DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR DATA TO THIRD PARTIES?</span>
        <br />
        We do not sell any data and we do not disclose your personal information
        to any third parties, unless required to provide you with the Services
        or by applicable law.
        <br />
        If you obtained our Services through any of our GHOST Reseller Partners,
        please note that we may disclose limited information to the extent
        necessary with our GHOST Reseller Partners that facilitate the provision
        of the Services (e.g. by providing assistance with respect to the
        maintenance and development of our Services).
        <br />
        While we generally do not disclose personal information to third
        parties, for full transparency we note that the suppliers we use in
        connection with the Services include our Website suppliers which create
        and manage mailing lists, newsletters and automated marketing campaigns,
        and website analytics platforms may have access to information provided
        voluntarily by a user through the Website or when communicating with
        GHOST, as detailed in the “Website” section of this Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        GHOST always makes reasonable efforts to ensure that suppliers and third
        parties use the limited personal information they may have access to in
        a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>10. TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT</span>
        <br />
        You can decide to cease using the Services and delete GHOST’s
        applications from your device at any time, or we can terminate your
        account in accordance with our Terms of Use. After your account is
        deleted, the data contained on your devices will be irrevocably erased
        and you will not be able to retrieve your information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>11. LAW ENFORCEMENT</span>
        <br />
        Our Services must be used solely for lawful purposes, in full compliance
        with applicable laws. While GHOST is committed to protecting your
        privacy and security, we may be required by applicable law to disclose
        personal information to law enforcement authorities. However, we will
        only release the information requested by law enforcement authorities
        when compelled to do so by court order, warrant, subpoena or other legal
        authority issued by a court or competent authority, in compliance with
        applicable laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>12. MINIMUM AGE</span>
        <br />
        We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of
        children. The Services are not intended for minors, who should not use
        the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>13. YOUR DATA RIGHTS</span>
        <br />
        We are committed to respecting the highest standards on data protection
        and privacy and, as such, this section applies to all users of our
        Services around the world, and not only to users in the European Union.
        <br />

        <br />
        <span>14. ACCESSING, CORRECTING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
        <br />
        Requests for access to, or for necessary corrections, additions or

        may be made by contacting GHOST by email at{' '}
        <a href="">legal@GoGhost.org</a>. We will respond to your request as
        quickly as possible and will need to verify your identity before
        providing you with access to the personal information we hold about you.
        In some cases, we may be unable to accommodate your request if we are
        unable to verify your identity, if we are prohibited by law, if
        disclosure would result in the disclosure of the personal information of
        others, or if the request is unreasonable or impractical. If we are
        unable to process your request for these or any other reasons, we will
        provide you with an explanation of the reason for denial, and you will
        be permitted to request a review.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>15. NOTIFICATIONS AND WITHDRAWING OF CONSENT</span>
        <br />
        GHOST may communicate with you to inform you about changes, important
        information with regard to the Services, information we believe may
        interest you, or with your consent. GHOST will generally use the same
        means of communication you chose to contact GHOST or the preferred means
        specified by you. You can always unsubscribe from any promotional
        emails.
        <br />
        If you are a registered user of our messaging service, you may receive
        notifications in the notifications section within the applications. With
        your consent, we may send push notifications or alerts to your mobile
        device even when you are not logged in. At any time, you can manage your
        push notification preferences or deactivate these notifications at any
        time by turning off the notifications settings in the device settings of
        your mobile device.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>16. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</span>
        <br />
