        As outlined in <a>Section 3</a> of the Information Request Guidelines,
        GHOST does not have access to read or review User Content. Therefore,
        where the information sought pursuant to a valid law enforcement request
        relates to User Content, GHOSTâ€™s response to this request will reflect
        the fact that GHOST does not have access to the content, that the
        encrypted ephemeral files and information sent and received using the
        Services is encrypted and indecipherable.
