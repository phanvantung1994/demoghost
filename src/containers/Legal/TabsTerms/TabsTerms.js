        <span>Data Backup</span>
        <br />
        We maintain our own backups in the event of a disaster; however, we do
        not store any data beyond contact lists and required key server
        information for Services. If you lose access to your device with the

        phrase your account will be illegible and irretrievable. Your data is
        fully encrypted and only decryptable by you therefore we make no
        promises with regards to backups, nor guarantee your content in any way.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Data Deletion</span>
        <br />
        Any data deletion or removal feature offered by GHOST through the App or
        otherwise (Data Deletion) will generally be available in the following
        circumstances:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            You wish to delete your communications or other data within the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have performed the maximum failed attempts (2-10) to enter your
            password to sign into your Account, as set in your App settings
            configuration.

          <li>You Remote Wipe your Account.</li>
          <li>Your Account expires or is terminated.</li>

        We recommend that you backup the information stored on your account on a
        regular basis, or prior to using any Data Deletion feature (otherwise
        than through any GHOST back-up feature). When your Account expires or is
        terminated, the GHOST data contained on your account will generally be
        irrevocably erased.
        <br />
        GHOST assumes no responsibility for the use of any Data Deletion feature
        and is not responsible for any loss of data on your account. In
        particular, the GHOST Parties will in no event be liable for the loss of
        any data on your or their accounts resulting from use of the use of Data
        Deletion features. GHOST will not be responsible for any delays in
        performing data deletion under the “Remote Wipe” feature arising out of
        any circumstances, nor will GHOST be responsible if the data is not
        deleted in its entirety. This exclusion of liability will apply to the
        fullest extent permitted by law.

        If GHOST finds out or reasonably suspects that you used or are using the
        Services for any Non-Permitted Use, GHOST reserves the right to suspend
        or terminate your Account or otherwise refuse to provide you access to
        the Services (or any part thereof), even if the order was placed and
        confirmed or the Non-Permitted Use has ceased. The right of GHOST to
        suspend or terminate your Account is without prejudice to any other
        remedy that GHOST may have or reasonable action that GHOST may take.

        <h1>Disclaimer and Liabilities</h1>
        <span>Services Provided</span>
        <br />
        GHOST focuses profound attention on updating and upgrading its
        applications and services in order to provide best-in-class protection
        against current and developing data security risks.
        <br />
        As such, to the fullest extent allowed under applicable laws: (a) the
        Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any
        warranty of any kind, and (b) GHOST disclaims all express implied, oral
        or written guarantees, warranties and representations pertaining to: (i)
        the communication, (ii) the suitability of the services and content for
        a particular purpose or the fact that the Services and content will meet
        your expectations, (iii) the fact that they will run without delays,
        errors or interruptions and that such delays, interruptions or errors
        will be addressed in a timely fashion (or can be addressed at all), (iv)
        the fact that the Services and their content are or will remain
        compatible with your devices, (v) the absence of adverse effect on your
        system, technology or data, and (vi) the Services’ merchantability other
        than as provided for herein.
        <br />
        Furthermore, even if GHOST makes reasonable efforts in order for the
        description of the Services and other content to be complete and
        current, the foregoing may include inaccuracies, typographical errors
        (and other errors) and omissions relating to the description and
        availability, or other information. For instance, the Services may
        display information about some features that are no longer available (or
        slightly changed).
        <br />
        Likewise, some features may be deleted, upgraded or modified.
        <br />
        Furthermore, GHOST does not control the information offered or made
        available on or through the Services. Accordingly, GHOST insists on the
        fact that it is not making representations or warranties that the
        information will be accurate or complete, up-to-date or relevant, and
        accordingly any decision, action taken, or failure to act, in reliance
        on any content or Services is your sole responsibility and liability.
        <br />
        You understand and agree that the access or use of the Services is left
        to your entire discretion and hence, is made at your own risks. GHOST
        disclaims any responsibility regarding the use of the Services, and is
        not responsible for any damage, including damages caused by use or
        misuse of the Services, subject however to applicable laws.
        <br />
        This warranty disclaimer extends to any oral or written information you
        may have received from GHOST, its employees, third-party Vendors, agents
        or affiliates. You may not rely on such information.
        <br />
        Some jurisdictions do not allow GHOST to exclude certain warranties. If
        this applies to you, your warranty is limited to 90 days from the
        effective date for an individual service.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Limitation of Liability</span>
        <br />
        Under no circumstances will GHOST or any other entity of the GHOST
        Agency, their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders,
        affiliates, business partners and third-party contractors, suppliers and
        licensors (collectively, the GHOST Parties) be liable to you, or to any
        other party, for any losses, costs or damages of any kind or nature
        whatsoever that are suffered or incurred in any connection with the use
        of (or the inability to use) the Services, or any GHOST Content
        (regardless of the form of action or theory of liability, including for
        breach of contract, tort, negligence, equity, strict liability, by
        statute or otherwise and regardless of the occurrence of a fundamental
        breach or failure of essential purpose).
        <br />
        In no event whatsoever will any of the GHOST Parties be liable for any
        special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental or indirect
        damages of any kind or nature whatsoever that are suffered or incurred
        in connection with the provision of the Services (including in
        connection with the transmission or downloading or storage of any data
        or submissions to or from the Services or the use of, or reliance on,
        any GHOST Content or other information or data contained on or provided
        through the Services, or loss of or damage to files or data or theft of
        your data or information that may occur if you do not implement
        passcodes or your failure to protect your device or other access
        safeguards or any costs of recovering or reproducing any files or data
        or loss of use or lack of availability of services or any business
        interruption or loss of revenue, opportunity or profit or any other
        economic loss whatsoever) however caused and regardless of the form or
        cause of action and whether or not foreseeable, even if the GHOST
        Parties or any of them has been informed in advance or ought reasonably
        to have known of the potential for such damages.
        <br />
        This exclusion of liability will apply to the fullest extent permitted
        by law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Indemnification</span>

        survive any termination of these TOS. For the purpose of this paragraph
        only, the term “you” as set out in sub-paragraphs (i) through (vi)
        include you, End Users, visitors to your website, and users of your

        You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, orally, in writing

        <span>Modification of these Terms of Service</span>

        GHOST reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, replace or

        will not constitute a breach of these Terms of Service.
